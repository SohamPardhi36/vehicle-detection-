Step 1: Setting up the Environment
You'll need a few more libraries for license plate recognition. The most common approach uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Install the Tesseract OCR Engine: This is a powerful, open-source OCR engine.

Windows: Download the installer from the Tesseract-OCR GitHub page.

macOS: Install via Homebrew: brew install tesseract

Linux: Install via a package manager: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr

Install Python Libraries:

Pytesseract: A Python wrapper for Tesseract. pip install pytesseract

OpenCV: pip install opencv-python

NumPy: pip install numpy

Step 2: Vehicle Detection and Counting with a Video File
Instead of a live stream, you'll simply point your cv2.VideoCapture object to the path of your video file. The rest of the logic for detection and counting remains the same.

Prepare a Video: Get a video file with traffic footage and place it in your project folder.

Modify the Code: In your main.py file, change the cv2.VideoCapture line:

Python

video_path = 'traffic_video.mp4'  # Replace with your video file name
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
Step 3: Integrating License Plate Recognition
This is the most complex part of the project. The process for LPR is a pipeline:

Detect a vehicle using your existing code.

Find the license plate within the detected vehicle.

Crop the license plate image from the frame.

Process the cropped image for better clarity.

Use OCR to read the text on the plate.

A. Add the LPR Code: Add a new function to your main.py file. This function will take a detected vehicle's bounding box as input.
